* [Image Rotation from weak Lensing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08631.pdf): Forthcoming radio surveys will include full polarisation information, which can be potentially useful for weak lensing observations. We propose a new method to measure the (integrated) gravitational field between a source and the observer, by looking at the angle between the morphology of a radio galaxy and the orientation of the polarisation. For this we use the fact that, while the polarisation of a photon is parallel transported along the photon geodesic, the infinitesimal shape of the source, e.g. its principal axis in the case of an ellipse, is Lie transported. As an example, we calculate the rotation of the shape vector with respect to the polarisation direction which is generated by lensing by a distribution of foreground Schwarzschild lenses. For radio galaxies, the intrinsic morphological orientation of a source and its polarised emission are correlated. It follows that observing both the polarisation and the morphological orientation provides information on both the unlensed source orientation and on the gravitational potential along the line of sight.

* [Brightest Cluster Galaxies Trace Weak Lensing Mass Bias and Halo Triaxiality in The Three Hundred Project](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01673.pdf): 星系团的BCG的轴向与晕的轴向相关，可得到投影效应对WL质量估计的影响。用模拟数据，得到BCG的方向与晕的质量相关。用投影的BCG核的聚集度与总的恒星质量（代表BCG方向）作比较，得到聚集度不是相关于WL质量的bias，而是总的晕质量。结果显示大样本的BCG的形状和方向可以估计WL的质量。
