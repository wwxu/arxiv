* [Image Rotation from weak Lensing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08631.pdf): Forthcoming radio surveys will include full polarisation information, which can be potentially useful for weak lensing observations. We propose a new method to measure the (integrated) gravitational field between a source and the observer, by looking at the angle between the morphology of a radio galaxy and the orientation of the polarisation. For this we use the fact that, while the polarisation of a photon is parallel transported along the photon geodesic, the infinitesimal shape of the source, e.g. its principal axis in the case of an ellipse, is Lie transported. As an example, we calculate the rotation of the shape vector with respect to the polarisation direction which is generated by lensing by a distribution of foreground Schwarzschild lenses. For radio galaxies, the intrinsic morphological orientation of a source and its polarised emission are correlated. It follows that observing both the polarisation and the morphological orientation provides information on both the unlensed source orientation and on the gravitational potential along the line of sight.

* [KiDS-1000: Constraints on the intrinsic alignment of luminous red galaxies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02556.pdf): We constrain the luminosity and redshift dependence of the intrinsic alignment (IA) of a nearly volume-limited sample of luminous red galaxies selected from the fourth public data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000). To measure the shapes of the galaxies, we used two complementary algorithms, finding consistent IA measurements for the overlapping galaxy sample. The global significance of IA detection across our two independent luminous red galaxy samples, with our favoured method of shape estimation, is ∼ 10.7σ. We find no significant dependence with redshift of the IA signal in the range 0.2 < z < 0.8, nor a dependence with luminosity below Lr 􏰁 2.9 × 1010h−2Lr,⊙. Above this luminosity, however, we find that the IA signal increases as a power law, although our results are also compatible with linear growth within the current uncertainties. This behaviour motivates the use of a broken power law model when accounting for the luminosity dependence of IA contamination in cosmic shear studies.
