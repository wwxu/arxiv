* [FAST Globular Cluster Pulsar Survey: Twenty-Four Pulsars Discovered in Fifteen Globular Clusters](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08559.pdf): We present the discovery of 24 pulsars in 15 Globular Clusters (GCs) using the Five-hundred- meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST).

The X-axis is the phase, [0-1] is the phase of [0,2pi], that is the signal in 1 period. The Y-axis is the time sequence. 
Assuming a single pulsar, the plot shows the two peaks in total. But for the pulsar in binary, whose orbital plane is not face-on to us, the Kepler redshift cause the phase change with the orbital period. 
In the second plot, the period of the curve in vertical direction is the orbital period.
