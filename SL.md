* [A Gravitationally Lensed Supernova with an Observable Two-Decade Time Delay](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08935.pdf): 
Here we report the discovery of a multiply-imaged supernova that will enable a time delay measurement with an uncertainty of < 1%. It appeared in an evolved galaxy at z = 1.95, gravitationally lensed by a massive foreground galaxy cluster. In archival HST imaging, three lensed images of the supernova are detected with relative time delays of <200 days. We predict a fourth image will appear close to the cluster core in the year 2037±2. Observation of the fourth image could provide a time delay precision of ≈ 7 days over an extraordinary 20 year baseline.

We have extracted spectra for each HST detected source and inspected them for redshift measurements. In addition, we have run the muselet software (pub- licly available as part of the MPDAF package(https://mpdaf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/muselet.html), 
In order to correctly estimate the magnification fac- tors, time delays, and predict the appearance of the fu- ture images of AT 2016jka we need to precisely model the mass distribution in the MACSJ0138 cluster core. To do so we make use of the latest version of LENSTOOL(publicly available at https://git-cral.univ-lyon1.fr/lenstool/lenstool), which performs a Bayesian analysis with an MCMC sampler to estimate the best fit and uncertainty on each parameter of the mass distribution.
