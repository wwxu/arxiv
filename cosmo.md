General relativity predicts that the rotational momentum flux of matter twists the spacetime via a vector gravitomagnetic (frame-dragging) field, which so far remains undetected in cosmology. This vector field induces an additional gravitational lensing effect; at the same time, the momentum field sources the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (kSZ) effect. The common origin of these two effects allows us to probe the gravitomagnetic signal via their cross-correlations. In this paper, we explore the possibility of detecting the gravitomagnetic field in ΛCDM by cross-correlating the weak lensing convergence field with the CMB temperature map, which is imprinted with the kSZ signal. This approach allows us to extract the gravitomagnetic effect.
