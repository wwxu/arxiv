1. [Abell 2626 and friends: large and small scale structure](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08806.pdf): New MMT/Hectospec spectroscopy centered on the galaxy cluster 
A2626 and covering a ∼1.8 deg2 area out to z ∼ 0.46 more than doubles the number of galaxy redshifts in this region. The spectra confirm four clusters 
previously identified photometrically. A2625, which was previously thought to be a close neighbor of A2626, is in fact much more distant. The new data 
show six substructures associated with A2626 and five more associated with A2637. There is also a highly collimated collection of galaxies and galaxy 
groups between A2626 and A2637 having at least three and probably four substructures. At larger scales, the A2626–A2637 complex is not connected to 
the Pegasus–Perseus filament.
