* [An exquisitely deep view of quenching galaxies through the gravitational lens: Stellar population, morphology, and ionized gas](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08338.pdf): This work presents an in-depth analysis of four gravitationally lensed red galaxies at z = 1.6 − 3.2. The sources are magnified by factors of 2.7 – 30 by foreground clusters, enabling spectral and mor- phological measurements that are otherwise challenging.
